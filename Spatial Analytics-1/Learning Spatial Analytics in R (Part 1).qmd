## What is Spatial Analytics?

Spatial and Spatio-temporal data is all around us. In televisions and newspapers, we repeatedly see reporters informing the viewers *What are the chances of rain today?*, *How the weather conditions vary between Karachi and Islamabad?*. Beyond asking simple questions, spatial data is necessary for making maps and visualizations to understand how the variations occur between the underlying regions. To make it simple, Geospatial data combines *locations* such as regions, streets or census block with information in the database. *Spatial Data Analysis* is concerned with questions not directly answered by looking at the data themselves. Statistical inference for such hypothesis is often challenging since it needs spatial data handling, spatial analysis and spatial modelling.

In this blog series we will learn and understand the fundamentals of Spatial Data Science. 


## Why use R for Spatial Analysis

For over 20 years, **R** community has developed number of R packages for handling and analysing spatial data. Upto 2003, these packages used to make different assumptions about how spatial data were organised. After some joint effort, the community developers wrote **R** package **sp** which *extends* base R classes and methods for spatial data. Classes specify a structure and define how spatial data is organized and stored while Methods are instances of functions specialised for particular class. Due to **sp** package, R community got enhanced tools for understanding Spatial data. Therefore, for our blog series we will use **sp** package and understand the different methods and classes of it.
