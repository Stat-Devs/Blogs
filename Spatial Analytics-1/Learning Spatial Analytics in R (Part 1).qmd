## What is Spatial Analytics?

Spatial and Spatio-temporal data is all around us. In televisions and newspapers, we repeatedly see reporters informing the viewers *What are the chances of rain today?*, *How the weather conditions vary between Karachi and Islamabad?*. Beyond asking simple questions, spatial data is necessary for making maps and visualizations to understand how the variations occur between the underlying regions. To make it simple, Geospatial data combines *locations* such as regions, streets or census block with information in the database. *Spatial Data Analysis* is concerned with questions not directly answered by looking at the data themselves. Statistical inference for such hypothesis is often challenging since it needs spatial data handling, spatial analysis and spatial modelling.

In this blog series we will learn and understand the fundamentals of Spatial Data Science. 


## Why use R for Spatial Analysis

For over 20 years, **R** community has developed number of R packages for handling and analysing spatial data. Upto 2003, these packages used to make different assumptions about how spatial data were organised. After some joint effort, the community developers wrote **R** package **sp** which *extends* base R classes and methods for spatial data. Classes specify a structure and define how spatial data is organized and stored while Methods are instances of functions specialised for particular class. Due to **sp** package, R community got enhanced tools for understanding Spatial data. Therefore, for our blog series we will use **sp** package and understand the different methods and classes of it. 


## What is GIS

Spatial data storage and analysis is traditionally done in Geographical Information System (GIS). According to @burrough_1998 a GIS is ‘. . . a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving at will, transforming, and displaying spatial data from the real world for a particular set of purposes’. 

For many spatial projects, using GIS is enough for the project requirements, but **R** makes a good choice for spatial data because of its capability in data analysis and visualization. Now a days **R** scripts are used with GIS software and possibly GIS database as well. 

## Types of Spatial Data

Before we move to spatial analysis and its equivalent classes, we must be clear in types of Spatial Data types. A broad understanding of spatial data is following by @roger_2013:

**Spatial data have spatial reference : they have coordinate values and a system of reference for these coordinates.**

As a simple example, we consider a locations of all famous mountain peaks in Pakistan. We could list the locations of these mountain peaks as pairs of longitude/latitude decimal degree values with respect to the prime meridian at Greenwich and zero latitude at the equator. 

Suppose we are interested in the temperatures between 1990 - 2020 on these mountain peaks. This information is called as *attribute*:

** A non spatial entity but this information will exist for each spatial entity that is mountains. **
