## Introduction

In my last article, I explained the building blocks of **Spatial** and **SpatialPoints** class. But that was only one part of the concept.

In this article, I would extend the discussion of SpatialPoints to **Methods** and **Data Frames** for Spatial Point Data.

If you want to have recap of SpatialPoints, you can find it here
