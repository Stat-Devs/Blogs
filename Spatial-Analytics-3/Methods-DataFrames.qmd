In my last article, I explained the building blocks of **Spatial** and **SpatialPoints** class. But that was only one part of the concept. Since in real world problems, spatial data would use much broader use of SpatialPoints. In this article, I would extend the discussion of SpatialPoints to **Methods** and **Data Frames** for Spatial Point Data.

If you want to have recap of SpatialPoints, you can find it here:

[Spatial Objects And Points in R](https://medium.com/@muzairaslam/spatial-objects-and-points-in-r-d85e42f716ee)


## Methods

Methods are available to access the values of the slots of Spatial objects. Here I will explain two important Methods for dealing with **SpatialPoints**.

1. bbox(): It returns the bounding box an object. It is used for data handling and data visualization of **SpatialPoints** class.
2. proj4string(): Sets or retrieves projection attributes on classes extending SpatialData.
2. coordinates(): It extracts the coordinates from **SpatialPoints** class. 
3. summary(): It reports the number of spatial entities, the projection information, and the
bounding box in **SpatialPoints** class.

To have a deeper understanding what each of these methods in the **sp** package, I read a data file with the positions of CRAN mirrors across the world in 2005.

```{r dataloading}
#| cache: true

library(sp)

df <- read.table("http://www.asdar-book.org/datasets/CRAN051001a.txt", header = TRUE)
```

Then we see its first six rows:

```{r}
head(df)
```
Now I will create **SpaitalPoints** object from it. From my last blog, we know that it requires two steps:

1. Get the data in the matrix form

2. Set up a CRS (Cordinate Reference System)

I start with making a longitude and latitude matrix
```{r}
# make a latitude and longitude matrix
cran_mat <- cbind(df$long, df$lat) 

# assign row names from 1 to number of rows
row.names(cran_mat) <- 1:nrow(cran_mat)

# view the matrix structure
str(cran_mat)
```
Then I make CRS (Coordinate Reference System) object: 

```{r}
# make a CRS object in longlat and World Geodetic System(WGS84)
CRS_obj <- CRS(projargs = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84")
```
Finally I create **SpatialPoints** object using the longitude and latitude matrix and CRS.

```{r}
# make a spatial points class by long/lat matrix and proj4string
cran_sp <- SpatialPoints(coords = cran_mat, proj4string = CRS_obj)
```

Now I use the first method : **bbox()** on our spatial object.

```{r}
bbox(cran_sp)
```

The first row reports the west-east range and the second the south-north direction.

Next I use **proj4string** method.

```{r}
proj4string(cran_sp)
```
THis shows the projection attribute of the Spatial Object.
